🎯 Let's divide the project into multiple phases - 

🍃 Phase1: Gathering dataset from Yahoo Finance Portal or using Yahoo Finance API (Load/Download Data) for Stock Price Prediction.

🍃 Phase2: Data Normalization & Creating Stacked LSTM Model -> Predicting future stock price(Plotting Inflation Graph).

🍃 Phase3:  Creating a Hybrid Dataset for Numerical Data(Stock - Open, High, Low, Close, Adj. Close, Volume) and Textual Analysis (News Headlines).

🍃 Phase4: Now Create Hybrid models for Numerical and Textual Analysis. As it is a Regression Problem Statement, I have used mainly three models to predict stock price such as Random Forest Regressor, Ensemble Learning: Adaboost Regressor, Xgboost Regressor. 

🍃 Phase5: Predicting Stock Price Inflation & Deflation By Doing Sentimental Analysis Of News Headlines.
